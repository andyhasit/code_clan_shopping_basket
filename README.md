# Shopping Basket

A code exercise for CodeClan interview.

## Exercise

You have been asked to model a shopping basket. We must be able to:
 - Add items to the shopping basket         
 - Remove items from the shopping basket         
 - Empty the shopping basket

Additionally, we must be able to calculate the total of the shopping basket 
accounting for:

 - Buy one get one free discounts on items         
 - 10% off on totals greater than Â£20 (after bogof)         
 - 2% off on total (after all other discounts) for customers with loyalty          
cards

There is no requirement to create a GUI but we must be able to see the code 
running correctly.

## Prerequisites

The program is written in Python 2.7, it **may** run on other versions.

I've tested this on Windows and Linux, but not Mac.

## Installing & Running

Either download and extract the zip, or clone this repo:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/andyhasit/code_clan_shopping_basket
```

You can then run it with:

```sh
$ cd code_clan_shopping_basket
$ python shopping_basket
```

This will run a quick demo printing output to the command line, showing basic functioning.

Here's an [online percentage calculator](http://www.percentagecalculator.co/Add-Subtract-Percentage.html) for quick checking.

## Unit tests

There are 18 unit tests, coverage is not complete, and there is no protection against edge cases or invalid input (not that there is a user interface).

The tests are written with [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/contents.html) which you will need to install if you want to run the tests:

```sh
$ pip install pytest -U
```
You may experience problems (in particular with it not finding the colorama lib) which you can usually fix by upgrading **pip** first:

```sh
$ easy_install --upgrade pip
```

You can then run the tests with:

```sh
$ cd code_clan_shopping_basket
$ py.test
```

## Comments on some decisions

Some of the decisions I made and why:

 - I decided against using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), as you may not by a Pythony person and it would just cause extra grief when all you want to do is check my code.
 - I used [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) instead of better alternatives because I want to avoid dependencies that might stop you running the app.
 - I used [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/contents.html) because I find it lets me write cleaner test code than Python's default unittest, although this is a depencency which you might stop you being able to run the tests, but not the app.
 - I put the test files in the same directory as the source files. That makes things easier for a project this size (plus thanks to naming convention you can immediately see if any source file doesn't have a test counterpart)

## Documentation

I put comments and explanations in the source code instead of in here, to avoid you jumping back and forth.

The best place to start is probably **\_\_main\_\_.py**, which runs the demo. The code in is just for you to tweak to see things run, it's not particularly well structured!

Everything else should be reasonably well organised, with mostly one class per file, and a test file named after the source file it tests.
